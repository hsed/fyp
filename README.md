# FYP Source Files 

## About



## Structure
- `datasets`: includes raw dataset files plus helper functions to load and/or debug and/or display raw information from dataset. Should include at-least one class of pytorch datasets derived type with `__getitem__` function
- `data_utils`: includes all functions that manipulate data in any way after being loaded in raw forma and before being input to any model. Also includes functions to collect results during testing i.e. perform inverse transformations or other manipulation to transform outputs from models back to the same scope as the raw data. These can be used to store evaluation results in the same format as gt labels.
- `utils`: all other extra helper functions needed during the training and/or testing can include:
  - Additional losses e.g. 3D avg error not directly used for the purpose of training.
  - Visualisation of training, tensorboardX, visualisation of final losses e.g. % of frames vs mm error.
  - Logging and progress-bar etc
- `ext`: anything from externel sources not currently in use but planned for future use, files in this folder is usually temporary
- `models`: All code defining models.
- `metrics`: including losses and eval metrics for validation etc. These files are to be moved.
- `trainer`: all code defining training and validation stuff for one epoch, these are referenced by top-level `train.py`
